## Robot Modeling and Control

- **[Modern Robotics - Mechanics, Planning and Control](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/images/7/7f/MR.pdf)** by Kevin M. Lynch and Frank C. Park

*A good introduction to many concepts of model-based robotics.*

- **[Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithms](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4899-7560-7)** by Roy Feathearstone

*A comprehensive collection of the best rigid-body dynamics algorithms.*

- **[A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation](http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~trink/Courses/RoboticsII/reading/murray-li-sastry-94-complete.pdf)** by Richard M. Murray, Zexiang Li S. Shankar Sastry

*A good mathematical introduction to various robotics concepts (includes Lie groups and screw theoretic description).*

- **[Geometric Fundamentals of Robotics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b138859)** by Jon Selig

*Geometric foundations of Robotics (demonstrates links to Lie Algebra, Study Quadric, Clifford Algebra etc.).*

- **[Robot and Multibody Dynamics: Analysis and Algorithms](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-7267-5)** by Abhinandan Jain

*Comprehensive textbook on multibody dynamics algorithms using Spatial Operator Algebra (SOA).*

## Numerical Computation and Optimization

- **[Convex optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/)**, Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe

*An excellent introduction of the theory and concepts of optimization as well as some important classes of algorithm with numerous practical exemples from various fields.*

- **[Numerical optimization](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-0-387-40065-5)**, Jorge Nocedal and Stephen J. Wright

*A comprehensive and up-to-date description of the most effective methods in continuous optimization, striking a good balance between theory and pratical implementation considerations. A must have for those wanting to implement their own solvers.*

- **[Optimization Algorithms on Matrix Manifolds](https://sites.uclouvain.be/absil/amsbook/)**, P.-A. Absil, R. Mahony, and R. Sepulchre

*A more advance and mathematically involved book, tackling the problem of optimization on non-Euclidean manifolds, which is getting some attention in robotics.*

## Applied Optimization

- **[Nonlinear Programming: Concepts, Algorithms, and Applications to Chemical Processes](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898719383)**, Lorenz T. Biegler

*This book addresses modern nonlinear programming (NLP) concepts and algorithms, especially as they apply to challenging applications in chemical process engineering. The author provides a firm grounding in fundamental NLP properties and algorithms, and relates them to real-world problem classes in process optimization, thus making the material understandable and useful to chemical engineers and experts in mathematical optimization.*

- **[Practical Methods for Optimal Control and Estimation Using Nonlinear Programming](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898718577)**, Second Edition, John T. Betts

*The book describes how sparse optimization methods can be combined with discretization techniques for differential-algebraic equations and used to solve optimal control and estimation problems. The interaction between optimization and integration is emphasized throughout the book.*
